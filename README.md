# dotfiles

### Setting up the dot files
  - In order to use these dotfiles run the symlink file to set up configs  
  - Currently the configs set up  
    1. .zshrc file  
    2. i3 config file  
    3. i3lock for multiple monitors  
    4. i3lock with Radical Ed symbols  
  - Things to do
    1. Make the symlink file more automatic  
    2. Add a requirements file of some sort (i3-gaps, i3blocks, ohmyzsh, etc)
